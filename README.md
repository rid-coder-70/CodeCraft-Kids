# CodeCraft Kids – Gamified Coding Adventure for Kids

![Project Banner]

## Project Overview
**CodeCraft Kids** is an interactive, gamified web application designed to make learning programming fun and engaging for children aged 10–15. The platform combines story-driven quests, coding puzzles, and game-building activities to teach fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, variables, and functions.

**Problem Statements:**
- Traditional programming education for kids is often abstract, difficult, or boring.
- Lack of interactive platforms that balance fun and real coding skills.
- Kids often lose motivation when transitioning from block-based to text-based coding.
- Limited collaborative and creative coding environments for children.

## Features
- **Story-Driven Gameplay:** Quests where coding drives the storyline.
- **Dual Coding Modes:** Beginner (drag-and-drop) and Pro (real code editor).
- **Coding Boss Battles:** Debugging challenges to defeat “bug monsters.”
- **Creative Sandbox Mode:** Free coding playground.
- **Progress Tracking & Rewards:** XP points, badges, streaks, and avatar upgrades.
